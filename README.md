# xorg-server-xlibre-void

## A series of package templates for running the Xlibre fork of X11 on void linux

## What this provides
- xlibre server (devel, Xephyr, etc)
- xlibre-input-libinput
- xlibre-input-evdev
- xlibre-minimal (includes all of the above)

## How to build

First, you need:
- A working installation of Void Linux (x86_64, glibc for now)
- a void-packages installationry
- the `xtools` package




# Notes
As noted on the xlibre repo itself, make sure to install the server and both input packages, otherwise you may break your system
